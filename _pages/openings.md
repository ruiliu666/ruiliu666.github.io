## Open positions1

<p>**Our lab will mainly use computational and theoretical approaches combined with multi-omics high-throughput sequencing data, but also wet-lab experiments if needed, to systematically understand gene regulation, cell differentiation and spatial cell-cell interaction in single cells, with focus on questions in developmental, stem cell biology and immunology.** </p>
<p>**We are always looking for creative, energetic and collaborative researchers to join our interdisciplinary team!**</p>


### Associate Investigator
<p>The candidates should have a Ph.D. in computational biology/bioinformatics/computer science/statistics or other quantitative fields, as well as excellent programming and communication skills. Substantial experience in analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is highly desirable.</p>

<p>Candidates with a Ph.D. degree in cell biology, molecular biology, immunology (etc.) with substantial experience and interest in quantitative fields/programming are also welcomed to apply.</p>

<p>The candidates would have ability to develop independent research programs/projects, and candidates with experience in postdoctoral training or research and strong record in research are strongly preferred.</p>

<p>The successful candidates will join a vibrant scientific environment devoted to basic science aiming at integrating research activities among partner institutes and conduct interdisciplinary research to address high-priority projects through the combination of complementary knowledge, methods and techniques.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining us, please send us an email along with a brief cover letter, a detailed CV and at least two recommendation letters. Please indicate “Application Associate Investigator (Your name)” in the email subject.</p>
